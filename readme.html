# _{TH-Simple_AJAX_Sidebar}_

#### _{Loads text via Ajax after button click}, {1/26/2016}_

#### By _**{Chris Underwood}**_

## Description

_{ A simple first AJAX project that loads text from sidebar.html into index.html after a button click. Uses XMLHttpRequest and standard AJAX flows. }_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

Download the files and open index.html. As with all AJAX programs, you will need a webserver to run the app. I used Browser Sync which automatically reloads the webpage after each save. https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-sync Once Browser Link is installed, go to folder where the application is saved and run browser-sync start --server --files "css/*.css, *.html" via the command line. The app should come up in the browser.

## Known Bugs

None that I am aware of
